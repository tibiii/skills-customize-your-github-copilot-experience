## 🎯 Objective

Build the classic Hangman word-guessing game using Python strings, loops, and user input to practice fundamental programming concepts and game development logic.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Create a Hangman Game

#### Description
Create a Hangman game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word before running out of attempts. The game should provide feedback on guesses and track the player's progress.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select words from a predefined list of at least 10 words
- Display the word as underscores initially (e.g., "_ _ _ _ _")
- Accept single letter guesses from the player
- Show correct letters in their proper positions when guessed
- Track and display incorrect guesses and remaining attempts
- End the game when the word is completely guessed (win) or attempts are exhausted (lose)
- Display appropriate win/lose messages with the correct word
- Ask if the player wants to play again

### 🛠️ Add Game Enhancements

#### Description
Enhance your basic Hangman game with additional features to make it more engaging and user-friendly.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Validate user input (reject numbers, symbols, and repeated guesses)
- Display a visual hangman drawing that progresses with wrong guesses
- Keep track of previously guessed letters
- Include words of varying difficulty levels
- Add a scoring system based on word length and remaining attempts
